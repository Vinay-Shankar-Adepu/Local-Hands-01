## 🚀 Setup Steps (5 Minutes)

### Step 1: Create Cloudinary Account

1. Go to **https://cloudinary.com/users/register_free**
2. Sign up using:
   - Email (or Google/GitHub)
   - Name: Your Name
   - Company: LocalHands (or your company)
   - Purpose: "Image storage for my app"
3. Click **Create Account**
4. Verify your email

---

### Step 2: Get Your Credentials

After login, you'll see the **Dashboard**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Cloudinary Dashboard                       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│  Product Environment Credentials            │
│                                             │
│  Cloud name:    dxy1234abc                 │  ← COPY THIS
│  API Key:       123456789012345            │  ← COPY THIS
│  API Secret:    abc***********xyz          │  ← CLICK "COPY"
│                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Copy these 3 values:**
1. **Cloud Name** (e.g., `dxy1234abc`)
2. **API Key** (e.g., `123456789012345`)
3. **API Secret** (click "Copy" button - it's hidden by default)

---

### Step 3: Update Backend .env File

Open: **`backend/.env`**

Find these lines:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name_here
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret_here
```

Replace with your actual values:
```env
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=dxy1234abc
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=123456789012345
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=abc123def456ghi789jkl
```

**Save the file** (Ctrl+S)

---

### Step 4: Restart Backend Server

In your backend terminal:

```bash
# Stop the server (Ctrl+C if running)
# Then start again:
npm run dev
```

You should see:
```
🚀 LocalHands API listening on port 5000
✅ MongoDB Connected successfully
```
