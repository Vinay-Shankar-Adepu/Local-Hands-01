# 🌟 Automatic Bidirectional Rating System

## Overview
Implemented an automated rating workflow that ensures both customers and providers review each service after completion, with visual indicators for review status and automatic progression through the review lifecycle.

---

## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. **Automatic Rating Prompts**
- ✅ When provider marks service as "Completed" → Customer automatically sees rating modal
- ✅ After customer submits review → Provider automatically sees rating modal
- ✅ No manual navigation required - prompts appear automatically on page load

### 2. **Bidirectional Reviews**
- ✅ Both parties can rate each other (customer → provider, provider → customer)
- ✅ Reviews are linked to the same booking ID
- ✅ Both reviews update respective user profiles' average ratings
- ✅ Reviews are stored in history and visible in profile previews

### 3. **Review Status Tracking**
The system uses a `reviewStatus` field with 5 states:
- `none` - Service not yet completed
- `provider_pending` - Provider marked complete, customer needs to review
- `customer_pending` - Customer marked complete, provider needs to review  
- `both_pending` - One party reviewed, waiting for the other
- `fully_closed` - Both parties have reviewed ✅

### 4. **Visual Indicators**
- 🟡 **"Please Review"** badge - Shows when user needs to submit their review
- 🟢 **"Fully Closed"** badge - Shows when both reviews are complete
- 📊 Badges appear on booking cards in both customer and provider dashboards

### 5. **No Edits After Submission**
- ✅ Once a review is submitted, it cannot be edited
- ✅ Backend checks for existing reviews before allowing new submissions
- ✅ `customerReviewed` and `providerReviewed` flags prevent duplicates

## 🔄 Complete Workflow

### Scenario 1: Provider Completes First

```
1. Provider clicks "Mark Complete"
   ↓
2. Booking status → "completed"
   reviewStatus → "provider_pending"
   ↓
3. Customer sees booking with "Please Review" badge
   ↓
4. Customer's rating modal auto-appears (on page load)
   ↓
5. Customer submits rating (stars + comment)
   ↓
6. reviewStatus → "both_pending"
   Alert: "Provider will now be prompted to rate you"
   ↓
7. Provider sees "Please Review" badge on booking
   ↓
8. Provider's rating modal auto-appears (on page load)
   ↓
9. Provider submits rating
   ↓
10. reviewStatus → "fully_closed" ✅
    Alert: "Service is now fully closed"
    ↓
11. Both profiles updated with new average ratings
```

### Scenario 2: Customer Completes First

```
1. Customer clicks "Mark Complete" (if enabled)

4. [Same flow as above, but reversed]
```

## 📊 Database Schema Updates

### Booking Model (`models/Booking.js`)
Added fields:
```javascript
customerReviewed: { type: Boolean, default: false },
providerReviewed: { type: Boolean, default: false },
reviewStatus: { 
  type: String, 
  enum: ["none", "customer_pending", "provider_pending", "both_pending", "fully_closed"], 
  default: "none" 
}
```

### Review Model (existing)
Tracks bidirectional reviews:
```javascript
direction: "customer_to_provider" | "provider_to_customer"
rating: 1-5 stars
comment: optional text
booking: linked booking ID
```

## 🛠️ Backend Implementation

### Modified Files

#### 1. `models/Booking.js`
- Added `customerReviewed`, `providerReviewed`, `reviewStatus` fields

#### 2. `controllers/bookingController.js`
- **`completeBooking()`** - Provider completion sets `reviewStatus = "provider_pending"`
- **`customerCompleteBooking()`** - Customer completion sets `reviewStatus = "customer_pending"`
- Both return `needsReview: true` flag to trigger frontend modals

#### 3. `routes/ratingsRoutes.js`
Updated both rating endpoints:
- **POST `/api/ratings/provider`** - Customer rates provider
  - Sets `customerReviewed = true`
  - Updates `reviewStatus` to `both_pending` or `fully_closed`
  - Returns `triggerProviderReview` flag if provider hasn't reviewed yet
  
- **POST `/api/ratings/customer`** - Provider rates customer
  - Sets `providerReviewed = true`
  - Updates `reviewStatus` to `both_pending` or `fully_closed`
  - Updates customer's average rating

#### 4. `routes/reviewRoutes.js`
Added provider review endpoint:
- **POST `/api/reviews/provider/:bookingId`** - Alternative review route
- Mirrors functionality of ratings route with review-specific logic

## 💻 Frontend Implementation

### Modified Files

#### 1. `pages/CustomerHome.js`

**Auto-trigger logic:**
```javascript
const loadBookings = () => {
  API.get("/bookings/mine").then((r) => {
    const bookings = r.data.bookings || [];
    setMyBookings(bookings);
    
    // Auto-trigger rating modal for newly completed bookings
    const needsCustomerReview = bookings.find(
      b => b.status === "completed" && 
      b.reviewStatus === "provider_pending" && 
      !b.customerReviewed && 
      !rateTarget
    );
    
    if (needsCustomerReview) {
      setTimeout(() => setRateTarget(needsCustomerReview), 500);
    }
  });
};
```

**Enhanced rating submission:**
```javascript
const response = await RatingsAPI.rateProvider({ bookingId, rating, comment });

if (response.data.triggerProviderReview) {
  alert("✅ Provider will now be prompted to rate you.");
} else {
  alert("✅ Service is now fully closed.");
}
```

**Visual indicators:**
- "Please Review" badge (yellow) - when `reviewStatus === "provider_pending" && !customerReviewed`
- "Fully Closed" badge (green) - when `reviewStatus === "fully_closed"`

#### 2. `pages/ProviderHome.js`

**Auto-trigger logic:**
```javascript
const loadBookings = () => {
  API.get("/bookings/mine").then((r) => {
    const bookings = r.data.bookings || [];
    setBookings(bookings);
    
    // Auto-trigger rating modal when customer has reviewed
    const needsProviderReview = bookings.find(
      b => b.status === "completed" && 
      (b.reviewStatus === "both_pending" || b.reviewStatus === "customer_pending") && 
      !b.providerReviewed && 
      !rateTarget
    );
    
    if (needsProviderReview) {
      setTimeout(() => setRateTarget(needsProviderReview), 500);
    }
  });
};
```

**Completion handler:**
```javascript
onClick={async () => {
  const response = await API.patch(`/bookings/${b._id}/complete`);
  alert("✅ Service marked as completed! Waiting for customer to submit their review...");
}}
```

**Visual indicators:**
- Same badge system as customer view
- "Please Review" appears after customer submits their rating

## 🎨 UI/UX Enhancements

### Rating Modal (`components/RatingModal.jsx`)
- 5-star interactive rating system
- Hover effects for better UX
- Optional comment field (max 1000 chars)
- Disabled submit button until rating selected
- Loading state during submission

### Status Badges
**"Please Review" Badge:**
```jsx
<span className="inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium 
  bg-yellow-100 dark:bg-yellow-900/30 text-yellow-700 dark:text-yellow-400 
  border border-yellow-200 dark:border-yellow-700">
  <FiStar className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
  Please Review
</span>
```

**"Fully Closed" Badge:**
```jsx
<span className="inline-flex items-center px-3 py-1 rounded-full text-xs font-medium 
  bg-green-100 dark:bg-green-900/30 text-green-700 dark:text-green-400 
  border border-green-200 dark:border-green-700">
  <FiCheck className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
  Fully Closed
</span>
```

---

## 📈 Rating Calculation

Both user types maintain aggregate ratings:

```javascript
// When new rating submitted:
const total = user.rating * user.ratingCount + newRating;
user.ratingCount += 1;
user.rating = total / user.ratingCount;
await user.save();
```

**Example:**
- User has 4.5 rating from 10 reviews
- New 5-star review comes in
- New rating: (4.5 × 10 + 5) / 11 = 4.545

---

## 🔒 Security & Validation

### Backend Guards
- ✅ Authentication required for all rating endpoints
- ✅ Role-based authorization (customer can only rate providers, vice versa)
- ✅ Booking ownership verification
- ✅ Status check (must be "completed")
- ✅ Duplicate prevention (`customerReviewed` / `providerReviewed` flags)
- ✅ Rating range validation (1-5 stars)

### Frontend Validation
- ✅ Disabled submit button until rating selected
- ✅ Loading states prevent double submissions
- ✅ Error handling with user-friendly alerts
- ✅ Auto-trigger only when review is actually needed
