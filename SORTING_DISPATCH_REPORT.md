## Test 1: Nearest Sorting ✅ PASS

**Request:** Customer at (12.97, 77.59) requests Plumbing with `sortMode=nearest`

**Provider Order (by distance):**
1. ProvB - 0.218 km, rating 3.5
2. ProvA - 0.267 km, rating 4.8
3. ProvC - 0.603 km, rating 4.2
4. ProvD - 0.636 km, rating 2.8

**Result:**  
✅ **Dispatched to: ProvB** (closest provider)  
✅ **Status: PASS** - Correct provider received request first

**Analysis:** Sorting purely by Haversine distance works correctly; closest provider gets the request regardless of rating.

---

## Test 2: Highest Rating Sorting ✅ PASS

**Request:** Same location, `sortMode=highest_rating`

**Provider Order (by rating desc, then distance):**
1. ProvA - rating 4.8, 0.267 km
2. ProvC - rating 4.2, 0.603 km
3. ProvB - rating 3.5, 0.218 km
4. ProvD - rating 2.8, 0.636 km

**Result:**  
✅ **Dispatched to: ProvA** (highest-rated provider)  
✅ **Status: PASS** - Correct provider received request first

**Analysis:** Sorting purely by average rating works correctly; highest-rated provider gets the request even if not closest.

---

## Test 3: Balanced (Normalized) Sorting ✅ PASS

**Request:** Same location, `sortMode=balanced`

**Balanced Formula:** `(normDistance * 0.7) + ((1 - normRating) * 0.3)`  
Where:
- `normDistance = distance / maxDistance` (0..1, lower is better)
- `normRating = rating / 5` (0..1, higher is better)
- Lower combined score = better match

**Provider Order (by balanced score):**
1. ProvA - score 0.3059 (rating 4.8, 0.267 km)
2. ProvB - score 0.3299 (rating 3.5, 0.218 km)
3. ProvC - score 0.7117 (rating 4.2, 0.603 km)
4. ProvD - score 0.8320 (rating 2.8, 0.636 km)

**Result:**  
✅ **Dispatched to: ProvA** (best combined score)  
✅ **Status: PASS** - Balanced formula correctly prioritizes ProvA

**Analysis:**  
- ProvA wins despite not being closest or furthest
- Excellent rating (4.8) + reasonable distance (0.267 km) yields best score
- Formula properly normalizes distance and rating for fair comparison
- 70/30 weight (distance/rating) balances proximity and quality

---

## Test 4: Offline Provider Exclusion ✅ PASS

**Setup:** Turn off ProvD (`isAvailable=false`)

**Request:** Plumbing with `sortMode=nearest`

**Result:**  
✅ Offers array does NOT contain ProvD  
✅ Only live providers (A, B, C) received offers  
✅ **Status: PASS**

**Analysis:** System correctly excludes offline providers from dispatch queue.

---

## Test 5: Distance Reactivity (Far Provider) ✅ PASS

**Setup:** Move ProvC far away (~15km east to 77.80 longitude)

**Request:** Plumbing with `sortMode=nearest`

**Result:**  
✅ ProvC was NOT dispatched first  
✅ Closer providers (A/B/D) ranked higher  
✅ **Status: PASS**

**Analysis:** Distance sorting reacts dynamically to provider location changes; far providers correctly deprioritized.

---

## Test 6: Queue Advancement on Decline ✅ PASS

**Setup:** Request with `sortMode=highest_rating`; first provider declines immediately

**Flow:**
1. ProvA receives offer first (highest rating)
2. ProvA declines via `/offer/decline`
3. System advances to next provider in queue

**Result:**  
✅ Booking has new pending offer  
✅ New offer is for a different provider (not ProvA)  
✅ Queue advanced correctly  
✅ **Status: PASS**

**Console Logs:**
```
[declineOffer] incoming 68e76f1412c11f5c1babf01b user 68e76f0e12c11f5c1babef9d
[dispatch] advanced offer -> provider=68e76f0f12c11f5c1babefa5 booking=68e76f1412c11f5c1babf01b totalOffers=2 remainingQueue=2
```

**Analysis:** Multi-provider queue system correctly handles declines and advances to next ranked provider within 10-second window.

## Key Findings

### ✅ Verified Behaviors

1. **Nearest Mode:** Pure Haversine distance sorting works perfectly
2. **Highest Rating Mode:** Pure rating-based sorting works perfectly
3. **Balanced Mode:** Normalized weighted formula (70% distance, 30% rating) works correctly
4. **Go-Live Enforcement:** Only `isAvailable=true` providers are considered
5. **Dynamic Distance:** Provider location changes immediately affect ranking
6. **Queue Management:** Decline triggers automatic advancement to next provider
7. **No Hardcoded Bias:** No evidence of 2@gmail.com or other email bias

### ✅ No Issues Detected

- ✅ Distance calculations accurate (Haversine formula)
- ✅ Rating weights applied correctly
- ✅ Balanced score normalization prevents unfair comparisons
- ✅ Offline providers excluded
- ✅ Provider relocations respected
- ✅ Queue advancement on decline functions correctly
- ✅ No duplicate offers or race conditions observed

### Formula Validation

**Balanced Score Formula (Normalized):**
```javascript
maxDist = max(all provider distances)
normDist = distance / maxDist  // 0..1
normRating = rating / 5        // 0..1
balancedScore = (normDist * 0.7) + ((1 - normRating) * 0.3)
// Sort ascending (lower score = better match)
```

**Example Calculation (ProvA):**
- Distance: 0.267 km, Rating: 4.8
- Max distance among all: 0.636 km
- normDist = 0.267 / 0.636 = 0.4198
- normRating = 4.8 / 5 = 0.96
- balancedScore = (0.4198 * 0.7) + ((1 - 0.96) * 0.3)
- balancedScore = 0.2939 + 0.012 = **0.3059**

## Recommendations

### For Production Deployment

1. **✅ All sorting modes ready for production**
   - Nearest, Highest Rating, and Balanced all work as expected
   - No bugs or bias detected

2. **Consider exposing Balanced mode as default**
   - Provides best user experience (quality + proximity)
   - Fair to both customers (nearby + good providers) and providers (rewards ratings)

3. **Monitor queue advancement timing**
   - Current 10s offer window is working
   - Consider metrics on decline rates per provider to identify patterns

4. **Add Customer Preference Settings**
   - Allow customers to choose default sort mode
   - Could add radius filter (already supported via `radiusKm` parameter)

5. **Provider Education**
   - Explain to providers how balanced mode works
   - Encourage maintaining high ratings for better dispatch priority
