## ⚙️ Configuration Needed

### **Image Upload Setup**

The frontend expects image URLs. You need to configure one of these options:

#### **Option 1: Cloudinary (Recommended)**
1. Create free account at https://cloudinary.com
2. Get your Cloud Name from dashboard
3. Create unsigned upload preset: `localhands_licenses`
4. Update `ProviderVerification.jsx` line 84:
   ```javascript
   'https://api.cloudinary.com/v1_1/YOUR_CLOUD_NAME/image/upload'
   ```

**See `IMAGE_UPLOAD_SETUP.md` for detailed instructions.**

#### **Option 2: Backend Upload**
- Create upload endpoint in backend
- Use Multer + Cloudinary/S3
- Update frontend `uploadImage()` function
- See `IMAGE_UPLOAD_SETUP.md` for code

---

## 📊 API Integration

All components use these API endpoints (already implemented in backend):

### **Provider Endpoints**
```javascript
POST /api/providers/submit-verification
Body: { licenseImage, licenseType, licenseNumber }

GET /api/providers/verification-status
Response: { onboardingStatus, licenseImage, rejectionReason, ... }
```

### **Admin Endpoints**
```javascript
GET /api/admin/verifications/pending
GET /api/admin/verifications/approved
GET /api/admin/verifications/rejected
GET /api/admin/verifications/stats
GET /api/admin/verifications/:providerId
POST /api/admin/verifications/:providerId/approve
POST /api/admin/verifications/:providerId/reject
Body: { rejectionReason }
```

## 🐛 Known Issues

### **1. Cloudinary Not Configured**
**Symptom:** Upload fails with "Failed to upload image"
**Fix:** Follow `IMAGE_UPLOAD_SETUP.md` to set up Cloudinary

### **2. CORS Error**
**Symptom:** "Access to fetch has been blocked by CORS policy"
**Fix:** Make upload preset "Unsigned" in Cloudinary settings

### **3. 403 Error on Go Live**
**Symptom:** Provider can't go live after approval
**Fix:** This is expected! Provider must refresh page to update user state in AuthContext

### **4. Stats Not Updating**
**Symptom:** Admin stats don't update after approve/reject
**Fix:** Already implemented - stats refresh automatically. Clear browser cache if issue persists.

## 💡 Tips

1. **Testing Tip:** Use Chrome DevTools → Network tab to monitor API calls
2. **Dark Mode:** Toggle in navbar to test both themes
3. **Search:** Use provider email to quickly find them in admin dashboard
4. **Mobile:** Test on real device, not just Chrome DevTools
5. **Performance:** Images are lazy-loaded, no performance impact
