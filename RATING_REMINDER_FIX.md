# Rating Reminder & Booking Cancellation Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Rating Reminder Shows Repeatedly âœ…

**Problem**: Rating reminder modal was appearing after every click/action because `loadBookings()` was called frequently and the session storage logic wasn't working properly.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented proper session-based reminder control using `sessionStorage.getItem('rating_reminder_shown')`
- Rating reminder now shows only:
  - **Once immediately after service completion** (if customer is active)
  - **Once after next login** if rating was missed
- Added session clearing on component mount to simulate fresh login
- Fixed both Customer and Provider rating reminder logic

**Changes Made**:
- `frontend/src/pages/CustomerHome.js`: Updated `loadBookings()` function with proper session control
- `frontend/src/pages/ProviderHome.js`: Updated provider rating reminder logic
- Added session flag clearing on component mount for both pages
- Fixed modal dismissal to prevent re-showing in same session

### 2. Customer Can Cancel While Waiting for Provider âœ…

**Problem**: Cancel functionality existed but had a missing toast import causing errors.

**Solution**:
- Fixed missing toast import by replacing with simple `alert()` messages
- Cancel button is properly displayed in WaitingScreen component
- Cancellation works for bookings in "requested", "accepted", or "in_progress" status
- User gets confirmation dialog before cancelling

**Changes Made**:
- `frontend/src/pages/CustomerHome.js`: Fixed toast import issue in cancel handler
- `frontend/src/components/WaitingScreen.jsx`: Cancel button already properly implemented
- Backend cancellation logic already working correctly

## How It Works Now

### Rating Reminder Logic
```javascript
// Customer Side
1. Service completes â†’ Rating reminder shows immediately (once)
2. If dismissed/missed â†’ Shows once on next login
3. Once rated â†’ Never shows again (localStorage flag)
4. Session flag prevents multiple reminders per session

// Provider Side  
1. Customer submits rating â†’ Provider rating reminder shows (once)
2. If dismissed/missed â†’ Shows once on next login
3. Once rated â†’ Never shows again
4. Session flag prevents multiple reminders per session
```

### Booking Cancellation
```javascript
// During waiting for provider assignment
1. Customer sees "Finding Provider" screen
2. Cancel button is available
3. Confirmation dialog appears
4. If confirmed â†’ Booking status changes to "cancelled"
5. Customer returns to main dashboard
```

## Technical Implementation

### Session Storage Keys Used
- `rating_reminder_shown` - Customer rating reminder control
- `provider_rating_reminder_shown` - Provider rating reminder control
- `lh_rated_[bookingId]` - Permanent flag in localStorage when rating submitted

### Backend Support
- `PATCH /bookings/:id/cancel` - Cancels booking (customer only)
- Supports cancellation for statuses: "requested", "accepted", "in_progress"
- Sets booking status to "cancelled" and adds `cancelledAt` timestamp

## Testing Scenarios

### Rating Reminder
1. âœ… Complete a service â†’ Rating modal appears once
2. âœ… Dismiss modal â†’ Doesn't appear again this session
3. âœ… Refresh page/login again â†’ Modal appears once if still not rated
4. âœ… Submit rating â†’ Never appears again for that booking
5. âœ… Multiple clicks/actions â†’ Modal doesn't spam

### Booking Cancellation
1. âœ… Book a service â†’ Waiting screen appears
2. âœ… Click "Cancel Request" â†’ Confirmation dialog
3. âœ… Confirm cancellation â†’ Returns to dashboard, booking cancelled
4. âœ… Cancel during "requested" status â†’ Works
5. âœ… Cancel during "accepted" status â†’ Works

## Files Modified

- `frontend/src/pages/ProviderHome.js` - Fixed provider rating reminder logic
- `frontend/src/components/WaitingScreen.jsx` - Already had proper cancel button
- `backend/src/controllers/bookingController.js` - Already had proper cancel logic

Both issues are now resolved and the user experience is much improved! ðŸŽ‰
