# 🔧 Twilio WhatsApp Authentication - Troubleshooting

## ❌ Error: "username is required"

This error occurs when Twilio credentials aren't properly loaded from the `.env` file.

### ✅ Solution:

**STEP 1: Restart Backend Server**

The backend server MUST be restarted to load the new Twilio environment variables.

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in terminal)
# Then restart:
cd backend
npm start
```

**STEP 2: Verify Credentials Are Loaded**

After restarting, you should see this in the console:

```
[Twilio] Credentials check: {
  accountSid: 'ACe67a4cbe...',
  authToken: '329a4414e9...',
  whatsappNumber: 'whatsapp:+14155238886'
}
```

If you see `MISSING` for any value, the `.env` file isn't being loaded properly.

## 🔍 Current Configuration

Your `.env` file has:
```properties
TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID=ACe67a4cbefcf8f7b0a2c12ae95e604188
TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN=329a4414e946d0362cc70ad20b40c390
TWILIO_WHATSAPP_NUMBER=whatsapp:+14155238886
```

These credentials look correct ✅
